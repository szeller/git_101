					<h1>Git 101</h1>
					<h3>Everything you didnâ€™t know that you needed to know about git</h3>
					<img src="img/rep.png"/>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is git?</h2>
					<blockquote>
  					A distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
					</blockquote>

          <br/>
					<ul>
					  <li>Developed by Linus Torvalds for managing the Linux kernel source</li>
					  <li>Built as a replacement for BitKeeper when the licensing changed</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Seriously, Shawn, what is it?</h3>

					<ul>
					  <li>A database of files, file diffs, and directory information which each git object chained together in a tree of objects stretching from the first commit to the latest</li>
					  <li>A set of command line utilities for managing the state of the database</li>
					  <li>The utilities also manage the state of a single working copy per checkout</li>
					  <li>Each checkout contains all the info necessary to construct the working state of any commit</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What git isn't ...</h2>
					<ol>
					  <li>User friendly</li>
					  <li>Opinionated</li>
					  <li>SVN</li>
					  <li>Straightforward</li>
					  <li>Github *</li>
					</ol>

					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						<small>
							* However, GitHub is the reason we are all using git today
						</small>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Beginner git mistakes</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Learning commands vs learning flows</li>
						<li>Not understanding how things work</li>
						<li>Not remembering what branch they are on</li>
						<li>Using merge instead of rebase</li>
						<li>Not using branches enough</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Topics you should look up later</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Understand all the options to <code>git log</code> - e.g. <pre><code class="nix" data-trim contenteditable>git log -2 -w -p origin/master^</code></pre></li>
						<li>Install git-up - https://github.com/aanand/git-up</li>
						<li>Learn how to set up aliases in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Everything is a reference</h3>
					<p>
					  In general, everything that you use to refer to an object (checkin/branch/tag/etc) in git is a reference into the giant tree of commits.  Some implications of this:
					</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>Branches are free since a branch is just a reference that moves whenever you do a commit</li>
					  <li>Tags are immutable references</li>
					  <li>HEAD is a reference to the current state of your working copy</li>
					  <li>When you delete a local branch, it doesn't actually go away</li>
					  <li>Any local commit can be recovered since whatever you do to your local view becomes a new commit</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Reference syntax</h4>
					<p>
						<pre><code class="nohighlight">
* ff2f4cd | (HEAD, foo) checkin some even better stuff (2 minutes ago) (Shawn Zeller)
* 4ba0f66 | checkin some great stuff (2 minutes ago) (Shawn Zeller)
* 337330e | (origin/develop, develop) restore /registry since that seems to be what we use for the health check (4 days ago) (Shawn Zeller)
*   d778846 | merge autoZK to dev (8 days ago) (austin chau)
|\
| * a205cc4 | use latest debian plugin (8 days ago) (austin chau)
						</code></pre>
					</p>
					<ol>
					  <li>337330e</li>
					  <li>HEAD^^</li>
					  <li>HEAD~2</li>
					  <li>develop</li>
					  <li>origin/develop</li>
					  <li>337330e3c25f6c615f0365cc592ed6f0a815fbf1</li>
					  <li>... all the same commit</li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Fun things you can do with git</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
						  <li>Diff state between any two commits <pre><code>git diff -w cd78ce87e1a HEAD main.coffee</code></pre></li>
						  <li>Create a branch from any commit <pre><code>git branch a/cool/branch/name cd78ce87e1a</code></pre></li>
						  <li>Remove all .deb files from the history of the repo <pre><code>git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch *.deb' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all</code></pre></li>
						  <li>Turn a subdirectory of a git repo into a top level repository <pre><code>git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter some_cool_folder master</code></pre></li>
						  <li>Deploy code! <pre><code>git push heroku master</code></pre></li>
						  <li>Host a static website - https://pages.github.com</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>You aren't branching enough</h3>
					<p>History of shared working brances should be treated as immutable once your commits have been shared.  Feature/working branches allow for:</p>
					<ol>
					  <li>Making sure that you don't accidentally break the build</li>
					  <li>Storing incremental work on github so that you can more easily show it to someone else</li>
					  <li>Making as many incremental commits as you want</li>
					  <li>Cleaning up your commit history later</li>
					  <li>In general, all work should be on a branch</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Modifying branch history the easy way - git reset</h3>
					<p>
						<pre><code class="nohighlight">
* ff2f4cd | (HEAD, foo) checkin some even better stuff (2 minutes ago) (Shawn Zeller)
* 4ba0f66 | checkin some great stuff (2 minutes ago) (Shawn Zeller)
* 337330e | (origin/develop, develop) restore /registry since that seems to be what we use for the health check (4 days ago) (Shawn Zeller)
						</code></pre>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>That last checkin sucked, delete it! <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^</code></pre></li>
						<li>Let's remove the last commit but keep the changes<pre><code>git reset HEAD^</code></pre></li>
						<li>Let's make one commit out of everything that isn't in develop already<pre><code>git reset develop
git add .
git commit -m "all my stuff"</code></pre></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Git Merge</h2>
					<p>
						<pre><code class="nohighlight">
* 337330e | (origin/develop, develop) restore /registry since that seems to be what we use for the health check (4 days ago) (Shawn Zeller)
*   d778846 | merge autoZK to dev (8 days ago) (austin chau)
|\
| * a205cc4 | use latest debian plugin (8 days ago) (austin chau)
						</code></pre>
						Pull another working tree into your tree.  Essentially does the following:
					</p>
					<p>
						<ol>
						  <li>Figure out what is the latest commit that both trees share</li>
						  <li>Apply all the changes to the working copy</li>
						  <li><em>Optional: </em>Allow the user to resolve any conflicts</li>
						  <li>Create a merge commit with the results of the merge that references both trees</li> 
						</ol>
					</p>

					<br/>
					<p>
						<small>
							<em>Note:</em> In the case of trivial merges, git updates the current branch to simply reference the HEAD commit for the branch to merge.
						</small>
					</p>

					<h3>Git Merge sounds great ... but</h3>
					<blockquote>
						Warning: Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.
					</blockquote>
					<p>What this really means is that reverting merge commits is a pain.  Also, it makes unraveling the history of the repo, equally painful.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>So, Shawn, what should we do to manage all of these branches that you tell us to have?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				  <h1>Git Rebase!</h1>
				  <h3>Yep, git rebase deserves an extra large title and transition slide</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
				  <h3>What is rebase?</h3>
				  <blockquote>Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head</blockquote>
				  <p>
				    Like many git commands, you can use rebase for a lot of things.  However, there are two main uses for rebase.
				  </p>
				  <ol>
				    <li>In interactive mode, it allows you to reorder, merge, alter, etc. some set of commits.</li>
				    <li>Used instead of merge, it allows you to take all of your commits and place them at the end of a tree</li>
				  </ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Interactive rebase example</h3>
				  <pre>
pick 2cad4d7 add some entries to .gitignore
pick 337330e restore /registry 
pick 4ba0f66 checkin some great stuff
pick ff2f4cd checkin some even better stuff

# Rebase ac0b6a7..ff2f4cd onto ac0b6a7
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Branch maintenance via rebase</h3>
					<p>You have a feature branch named foo branched off of master.  Since branching, more commits went into master.</p>
					<pre><code>git checkout foo
git rebase master</code></pre>
					<ul>
						<li>Rewind your branch (foo) back to the last point in the tree the branches share</li>
						<li>Pull everything from master into foo</li>
						<li>Apply each change that was rewound away to the branch again, one by one</li>
						<li><em>Optional:</em> Whenever there are conflicts, the user resolves the conflicts</li>
						<li>Once all resolution is done, your branch has all of your work after every commit in master.</li>
					</ul>
					<pre><code>git reset master
git add .
git ci -m "one commit with everything that was in foo"</code></pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Rebase Caveats</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>All of the rebased commits will have different hashes since they are a part of a different subtree</li>
						<li>Only rebase a branch that isn't shared since you will make everyone else's life painful</li>
						<li>Once you rebase, if you want to push to github, you'll have to use the -f option</li>
						<li>Rebase into feature branches and use merge for pull feature branches into shared branches</li>
					</ul>
